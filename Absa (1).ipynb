Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break!

of french food prep dont really appeal to me but since we were in montreal we wanted to eat at a french restaurant so we made a reservation at lexpress based on yelp reviewsnnwe skipped appetizers as none appealed to us although they served some really good bread  for mains i really decided to go french and had the hanger steak with fries sarcasm  it was really good not a big thick steak like in states but thin and really tender and flavorfull  not sure how they tenderize or prepared it but it was very good  my wife had the homemade raviolis which on this day were meat and mushroom filled and served with some type of beef sauce  they were really rich and tasty  we split a chocolate tart for desert and that was good toonnoverall we enjoyed our meal here\",\n          \"the atmosphere and decent brews make this place worth a visit  it just looks great and the beers while not the best are good and inventive mintmilk stout not my favorite but i love the attempt nnbeer prices are decent too  id recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar  there is one tv but this is a more relaxed family andor dinner atmospherennthe food is hit or miss  the 7 onion soup is awesome but at 450 a cup it better be  the pizza are pretty good made in a wood fired oven  the crust comes out doughy but not too thick  i had the chicken and chorizo pizza it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo ive ever seen  the service was really slow all around here took a while to get both drinks and food  far too long considering it wasnt even crowded when i visitednnbottom line its a cool place that warrants a visit there are some good beers but expect slow service\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

ridiculous especially for a place thats never too busy\",\n          \"let me start by stating that i dont have a lot of experience eating or preparing french food and some of the dishes and methods of french food prep dont really appeal to me but since we were in montreal we wanted to eat at a french restaurant so we made a reservation at lexpress based on yelp reviewsnnwe skipped appetizers as none appealed to us although they served some really good bread  for mains i really decided to go french and had the hanger steak with fries sarcasm  it was really good not a big thick steak like in states but thin and really tender and flavorfull  not sure how they tenderize or prepared it but it was very good  my wife had the homemade raviolis which on this day were meat and mushroom filled and served with some type of beef sauce  they were really rich and tasty  we split a chocolate tart for desert and that was good toonnoverall we enjoyed our meal here\",\n          \"the atmosphere and decent brews make this place worth a visit  it just looks great and the beers while not the best are good and inventive mintmilk stout not my favorite but i love the attempt nnbeer prices are decent too  id recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar  there is one tv but this is a more relaxed family andor dinner atmospherennthe food is hit or miss  the 7 onion soup is awesome but at 450 a cup it better be  the pizza are pretty good made in a wood fired oven  the crust comes out doughy but not too thick  i had the chicken and chorizo pizza it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo ive ever seen  the service was really slow all around here took a while to get both drinks and food  far too long considering it wasnt even crowded when i visitednnbottom line its a cool place that warrants a visit there are some good beers but expect slow service\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

            "perhaps its superbowl weekend that made boa seem sub par or maybe it was the fact that you can only get happy hour prices at the bar or even the way the bartender was more concerned about setting the tivo to record some tv show instead of serving us our last happy hour drink i just dont know either way i am not impressed at all with cafe boa for one the entire restaurant  was reserved until 930pm ok so lets sit outside you say ahhh but low and behold you cannot get happy hour prices outside would this be so bad if the bar wasnt 10 ft by 10ftprobably not so the happy hour area is small but luckily we were able to find a seat at the bar now the prices are good and they offer a decent amount of drink specials on everything from wine to beer to martinis however the food is limited i though the pinot noir i ordered half off was very dry for a pinot the food specials and sausage dish served in a marinara sauce was ok the sauce was interesting with capers and black olives it did give me some new ideas to experiment with when i make my sauce  unfortunately the sausage was dry like the pinot good pairing my date ordered a cappretta salad which was several tomatoes and some mozzarella and this cool soft cheese or badass as our bartender described it lol  that was very good but it was an extremely small portion  overall the service was decent i heard the energetic charismatic bartender drop several f bombs and the staff seemed somewhat wired like someone left a big basket of easter candy in the back and they all got into it sugar rushes aside overall the final bill tallied up to 30 without tip for 4 glasses of wine and 2 apps not bad you say since we missed one happy hour drink the bartender was cool enough to leave one of our drinks off the tab to balance it out as he said it was both our faults we missed that deadline with a smile i jokingly replied actually i just blame you i was kidding but also somewhat serious as he spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out the tivo settings um who has tivo in a bar anyway\n",

I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue.

When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, we were told it would be 30-60 min before our room was ready.  Not a huge deal, so we had the bell desk hold our bags and decided to check out the pool area.  As soon as we walked outside we hear extremely loud jackhammering going on.  They were using jackhammers at what looked like two of the four pools.  It was so loud we could stand side by side and not hear each other and it stirred up so much dust it was hard to see.  We immediately asked inside how long it would be going on.  They then told us it would be going on the entire weekend until 4 p.m. each day.  There was no indication of construction on the resort website or perfect escapes. Disappointing after $45 cab ride to the resort and then another $45 cab ride to another resort after then paying to use the hotel internet to find another resort.  I go to the Phoenix area often and have staid at Camelback Inn, Hyatt Gainey Ranch and Hotel Indigo.  All were wonderful accomodations.  From the look of this hotel on several websites, it was quite beautiful and relaxing and very comparable to the other resorts in the area.  Unfortunately, I never even made it to the room due to the construction.  It was not the relaxing weekend I had planned for.

The space is really big for a fro-yo shop with plenty of tables inside and out.  The toppings bar is on an island so you can actually walk around other customers instead of waiting on the guy ahead of you.  The sample cups are at the register, but left out so customers can take them at their own leisure instead of waiting for a free employee to hand you one.  There are two cup sizes (it's still big and huge, but at least there's an option).  Zoyo also features a little paper divider to split your cup in half.  What a simply brilliant idea.  You can put several flavors in a cup without them melting and mixing together.  Why does no one else offer that?\\\\n\\\\nSo on to the important part;  the flavors.  On the plus side, there are six machines (12 flavors plus 6 mixes).  Yay for variety!  I also like the consistency of the yogurts.  None of them came out of the machines soft or soupy.  What I did select actually stayed fairly solid all they way to the bottom of my cup.  On the negative side, most of the offerings were average at best.  Many just weren't all that flavorful.  However, the salted caramel was heavenly.  I would go back time and time again just to indulge in this.\"},\n",

The 3 whole times she came by she flirted with the gentlemen I was dinning with and even told him to stop by the register for her number. Hello? I was there!

It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!\\\\n\\\\n I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\\\\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.\\\\n\\\\nThe inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.  \\\\n  \\\\nMy grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.\\\\n\\\\nThe buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.  \\\\n\\\\nI'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.

The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. \\\\n\\\\nHow disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.\\\\n\\\\nMy dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. \\\\n\\\\nTwo comments on the service.

Green flecks that tasted like faint Pesto were also on the plate.  This concoction was very tasty, including the best Buffalo Mozzarella I have experienced to date.  Chef Marc imparted that this cheese was derived from water buffalo cow inhabiting the environs of Naples.\\\\n\\\\nSECOND COURSE: For a second course, we were presented with two very large platters of New York Style Hot Antipasto for every 3 diners, so that, try as we might, some of this delectable food was left behind.  We got to sample Eggplant rolled up like a burrito or Chinese Eggroll but not deep-fried; lovely Clams filled with Oregano, Parsley, and Bread Crumbs to become Clam Oreganata; naked Calamari; Mussels filled with Artichoke Hearts; and some Green Peppers and cut mushrooms spread throughout the hot platters like accent marks unifying all elements of this sumptuous and quite filling appetizer.  Would that Western Style Antipasto plates were this tasty and refined!\\\\n\\\\nAlso complementing this dish was excellent cheese-topped and crusty bread and butter.  But, alas, Chef Marc directed his servers to remove the bread soon after the repast began, lest we fill up too much on it.\\\\n\\\\nTHIRD COURSE: For the next course, we were treated to a very hot and nuanced Spinach & Walnut Risotto with flakes of Mascarpone Cheese circling \\'round the rim of the bowl.  This rich offering was quite flavorful without any single component overpowering the others.\\\\n\\\\nFOURTH COURSE: As a main course, set down before us was a bowl of rich, delicious, and fork-tender Slow-braised Neapolitan Veal Cheek, along with German-style Red Cabbage made with Brown Sugar and Red Wine Vinegar, and subtly flavored Polenta.  The star of this assemblage was the Veal Cheek, which tasted much like well-prepared Osso Buco.  And, Chef Marc confirmed that this entree did actually come from the cheeks of young calves.  \\\\n\\\\nFIFTH COURSE:  As a fifth and final course, we were treated to a dessert plate with slices of Green Apple, honey in a small pouring bowl, Blueberries, and somewhat springy planks of solid Parmesan Cheese that Chef Marc referred to as \\\\\"diving boards.\\\\\"  These elements were to be assembled and joined together according to our personal whims.  I found that dabs of honey acted like glue when Blueberries were pressed into them on top of a plank of cheese, and the conglomeration was further sweetened by adding a honey-soaked slice of apple into the mouth when chewing.  This sweet and cheesy dish was my least favorite course, but I appreciated the simplicity and inventiveness of the dish.  Everything else I thought was both creative and a foodie\\'s delight. \\\\n\\\\nThroughout the meal, Chef Marc or one of his assistants provided a running commentary of each course just before it was served, and patiently answered all diners\\' questions.  This added to the enjoyment of the experience, although in previous MANGIA! rounds Chef Marc did all the narration himself, which I liked better.\\\\n\\\\nMost of our group of about 17 diners experienced the Chef\\'s Table (some with wine pairings), but a few, like Diane, ordered ala carte.  And, she was quite pleased with the two quite large and lean scallops of Veal Parmesan Alfredo and Penne Alfredo with which she was presented.  Half of the order served as a fine lunch the next day.\\\\n\\\\nNelson and Sylvia Q. presented all diners with a vial of sand from different beaches in Hawaii, and did another great job in organizing this event.  Props to them for hosting, and to Chef Marc and his staff for preparing and serving, yet another outstanding MANGIA! dining extravaganza!'},\n",

Lucky for me, I found a deal that included flight and hotel for $500 for 4 nights.  Yay!\\\\n\\\\nI have stayed at the W Hotel in Montreal before, another boutique hotel but I just can't afford their prices without an expense account.\\\\n\\\\nThe Hotel Chez Swann is located on Drummond Street which is a hop, jump and skip away from downtown.  Peel metro station is located within a 2 minute walk and when Bixi bikes are in season (they stash them away in November), there is a Bixi stand right outside the hotel.  We pretty much walked everywhere and downtown was about a 20 minute walk away.  Not a bad way to work off the calories from all the yummy food to be had in Montreal.\\\\n\\\\nThe hotel itself has all the elements of a boutique hotel.  Dim lighting, funky decor, a peekaboo shower and even a plush seating area right in front of the window that looks out onto the street.  I couldn't help but feel I had walked into some sort of modeling shoot. \\\\n\\\\nPrior to arriving I had requested a room on the third floor because I didn't want there to be too much noise coming from the street.  However, being a factory-converted hotel, with only 3 floors, you could still hear the noise from the street at night.  But I slept through it all anyways.  We had a room with a great view of the street, thank goodness as I know one side of the hotel faces a parking lot!\\\\n\\\\nThe staff are all very friendly although on the first night of our stay, we noticed the sheets hadn't been changed and our toiletries hadn't been replenished - but they took our $2 tip anyways.  The next day I left a note requesting the said changes, and for the rest of our stay, these requests were met.  A nice thing that the cleaning lady did was stock our room with bottles of Eska water.  I guess she saw the insane stash of water we had in our room and saw us working out in the spin room!\\\\n\\\\nWe also requested a late checkout as our flight didn't leave until 8:30PM, and they extended it until 2PM without additional charges.  However, we didn't want to be wandering around town, so we just forked over the $80 to extend it until about 6:30PM.  \\\\n\\\\nBreakfast is served daily from 7AM - 10AM in the restaurant adjoining the hotel, Le Pois Pench\\\\u00e9.  The breakfast selection is heavy - all pastries (pain au chocolat, almond croissants, plain croissants, cheese croissants, muffins, danishes, french baguette with butter, fig jam, and strawberry jam).  There is also a selection of juices and milk.  But the Espresso machine was a nice extra touch.  It was a Nespresso machine, and I was wired for hours!  They have about 8 different kinds of espresso, along with the standard coffee and tea.  You absolutely HAVE to try the cheese croissants as they not only had cheese on the outside, but also on the inside.  I found the sweet pastries to be TOO sweet to eat first thing in the morning.  The plain croissants were also good.\\\\n\\\\nIf you don't want to be eating croissants every morning you can also visit Q Nutrition House which is located at the very front of the hotel and serves up protein shakes, and healthy fruit smoothies of all kinds - but it isn't free. \\\\n\\\\nFor those of you who are keeners, you can use the spin room.  It is equipped with a television, towels and complimentary bottles of Eska water.  I used it all 4 days I was there.  Complimentary phone calls anywhere in North America and free wi-fi (password provided upon check-in). \\\\n\\\\nThere was only one night where we could hear rowdy teens coming in from a night on the town (around 3AM).  But other than that I have no complaints!  I would definitely recommend Hotel Chez Swann and would definitely stay here again.\"},\n",

The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.

Because this location is near my office, I have patronized this Uptown site numerous times.  To me, Newk's Uptown feels like a smaller space than the other sites I have been to.  Nothing like the Newk's I visited in Springfield, MS (probably the best laid out one that I have ever been to) but similar to the one in Greensboro, NC.\\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere - Located in a former restaurant/ night club (same three or so steps to go up from the main entrance) the feel here is busy, noisy, more tables than booths, informal, messy (always feels like you just arrived after a lunch rush), fast casual order and delivery process.\\\\n\\\\nFood - Lots of choices that include sandwiches (toasted), salads, soups and pizza.  I usually get the chicken speciality sandwich, with ice tea and fruit.  This sandwich comes with grilled chicken applewood smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, olive oil, mayo and Honey Mustard on a decent in texture baguette.  I get this when I want to eat healthy by dropping the swiss cheese, mayo and honey mustard.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen I want to eat something that has a lot of flavor, I get the Italian.  It has capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami, provolone cheese, mayo, spicy creole mustard, lettuce, tomato, yellow onions, hot cherry peppers and Italian sauce.  While I do drop the mayo...just don't like it...this sandwich is still a  calorie and flavor indulgence.  \\\\n\\\\nService - It is good for a place that takes your order, gives you a number, a cup, a tray, and then makes you wait for the food to arrive.  On my several visits here everyone has been friendly (even when there is a mistake) and the place is always jammed.\\\\n\\\\nOverall - An okay, option for lunch in Uptown.  With drink you are over $10, which some have deemed pricy.  But when you think about about it, a Chick-fil-a combo is only a buck or two below that price and they don't bring it to your table.  \\\\n\\\\nTips:  \\\\n* Reinforce any special order requests as the staff has gotten it wrong in the past.\\\\n* During lunch, grab a table ASAP after ordering as they can vanish quickly!\"},\n",

The apps are pretty plain in their selection but for half off, who cares?  The beer selection is outstanding and they have rotating taps you should be sure to ask about if that's your thing.  \\\\n\\\\nThe pizza is good.  If you've never had Mellow pizza before it is definitely different that your standard pie.  Funky ingredients and chewy crust can make for a good meal.  Or it can be a $25 average pizza.  Unfortunately that's about what you'll pay.  Frankly it's just too much for pizza.  I don't mind dropping money on good food but when you consider the number of excellent pizza places in town it's hard to justify the prices here.\\\\n\\\\nThe part that really erks me though is the atmosphere.  It feels like a warehouse, the music is never at a good volume, and the service is slow.  I've eaten at Mellows all over the country and I have to say I enjoy this one the least.  That's a shame considering it's in my backyard.\"},\n",

Very consistent with the previous visit, but we were at the Bell Road location.  Portion was very small, I guess they want everyone to eat less pasta because its a fatten food.

It opened this year, 2012, in February, and you can tell that a lot of time and money was put in to the development of it.  It is still in pristine condition and let me say, it is fantastic.  \\\\n\\\\nI have to say that the beauty of this museum is that they made it interesting for everyone in the simple fact that no matter what YOUR way of learning is, there is something that will pique your interest.  You will discover the mafia connection in the United States from the early 1900s to the present, in print, in artifacts, in videos, and in sound.  It is three stories of amazing detail and experiences.  You'll hear from mafiosos and FBI agents.  You'll see movies and you'll hear real wiretaps.  You'll see the actual clothes worn in the golden age of Vegas Wiseguys and the actual barber chair that Albert Anastatsia was shot in.  The show in the ACTUAL courtroom where the Kefauver hearings took place was really wonderful.\\\\n\\\\nThere was only one thing that we saw that was a problem and that is they haven't finished adding all of the tags that tell you what things are.  For example, there is a graphic exhibit that discusses murders and the weapons used and the weapons are not labeled.  This is an area they are still completing.  It's still awesome to see, but I can't wait until they have that finished.\\\\n\\\\nWe visited this museum and paid our $18 a head to get in ($14 for seniors!).  We spent, approximately, 1 hour per floor on three floors that gave us the history of the mob from the top floor down to today.  It was one of the best museums I have visited and I highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas take some time to take a look at this.  I loved it and will probably visit again in the future.\\\\n\\\\nReally... do this  But, I don't recommend for children.  It's an adult experience.\"},\n",

The chicken skewers consisted of 2 small skewers with oddly reddish looking chicken that was seriously dry & overcooked.  The cheese ravioli thingies were also odd tasting and not especially good.

I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. \\\\n\\\\nSo I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?\\\\n\\\\nAt this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn\\'t correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. \\\\n\\\\nSo I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it\\'s always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn\\'t a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it\\'s normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn\\'t a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. \\\\n\\\\nUpon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. \\\\n\\\\nSo I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I\\'m too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. \\\\n\\\\nDay 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn\\'t clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn\\'t clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?\\\\n\\\\nDay 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a \\\\\"Do Not Disturb\\\\\" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. \\\\n\\\\nDay 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don\\'t get it. \\\\n\\\\nThe hotel staff doesn\\'t have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I\\'ve never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. \\\\n\\\\nOn another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn\\'t what I expected. It\\'s just sad that the customer service isn\\'t there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.'},\n",

I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. \\\\n\\\\nI stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.\\\\n\\\\nThe best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.\\\\n\\\\nI might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational.\"},\n",

However all is not lost: Behold the great Pho Thanh, the best Vietnamese food in the valley. Lets slurp up a bowl of pho-knowledge in this review on this restaurant!\\\\n\\\\n~Fud/Drink~\\\\nThis small, unassuming restaurant off of Camelback has amazing flavors popping out of the kitchen. The Pho is fresh, not made from different canned ingredients. The dishes are out of this world and very much authentic. For a good starter, the spring rolls they make are huge and sumptuous. With mint, shrimp, and pork, my personal favorite is Goi Cuon. As for entrees, by far the best out of my first three visits is #31 on the menu, Mi Xao Don . The freshly cooked veggies along with cooked pork and fresh broth-boiled seafood mix amazingly together atop a bed of crispy egg noodles. If you can stand waiting a few minutes, I suggest crushing the noodles, add a bit of soy sauce/ other sauces, and let the noodles soak it all in. All the dishes are succulent, savory, and the prices for the quantity of food is out of this world. I have left each time with leftovers, the portions are that big. They have over 100 separate dishes, the list is extensive, to say the least. They do not serve alcohol here, however the list of soft drinks and traditional Vietnamese offerings like baby coconut milk or thai tea is......extensive once again. \\\\n\\\\n~Atmosphere/Service~\\\\nThis is the reason they lose a star. I am not a big atmosphere person, unless it simply detracts from the experience all-together. There are three separate issues to point out. First, the music and decor in the restaurant....they  are \\\\\"interesting\\\\\". They have it seemingly on a looped CD with Vietnamese covers of popular American music. I cannot tell a lie, at one point \\\\\"She Bangs\\\\\" came on... I hadn\\'t heard that in over 5 years, folks. The decor is once again \\\\\"interesting\\\\\" and detracts from the experience. Instead of adding to the atmosphere and putting up traditional pictures or decor, they have two separate posters of a woman threading a blanket. TWO posters....as if one is not enough. Second, is the bathroom. You can smell it as you walk towards it. They seem to not have a scheduled time to clean up the bathroom each day, its pretty bad. Third, the service is extremely prompt, let me make this abundantly clear.  Faster than I have seen at most food establishments for that matter. But if you were to ask them for recommendations, it may prove to be difficult, as they are in a hurry to service other tables. We do not get many smiles or get asked how we are doing....To be honest, I am sure its a cultural thing. I shrug it off, if you take things like that to heart then you need to check yourself. Overall, these aren\\'t hideous issues, but a star lost is more than fair, in my mind.\\\\n\\\\n~Extras/Rating~\\\\nOverall, the food is outstanding. They get 4 stars for variety of choices, quality/taste of food, price point in comparison to quanitity, and lightning fast service. But honestly, \\\\\"She Bangs\\\\\"?  If not for those issues, its a 5 star top choice for me. Regardless, this has become my favorite go-to spot locally. I have gone 3 times the past two weeks, and at some point this week and next I shall go again....and I can\\'t wait. Bring on the Pho Thanh, I say!!!  Enjoy!'},\n",

Concession prices are more reasonable (still up there, but more doable).  I especially like all the room that I get in the actual theater.  The seats are comfy and I don't feel cramped.  Since there is less foot traffic, the staff is always friendly and I often strike up a brief conversation with them before going into the theater.\\\\n\\\\nSo, next time you want to go to the movies, give this one a go.

However, I wasn\\'t impressed at all with the chili cheese fries.  The chili was just average and was seasoned a bit too heavily with cumin.

Lastly, Tom\\'s is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. For the two burgers, chili cheese fries, and a large drink, we paid almost $18.  This is around what you would pay in Cali but the portions are much larger, so there is less value for the money with Tom\\'s......strike three against!! \\\\n\\\\nIf you live close by and like So Cali style charbroiled ghetto burgers, then you may enjoy Tom\\'s, but for me, it\\'s just not worth the drive from the other side of town.'},\n",

TGI Fridays promises a 20% return for everyone who turns in a flyer to their server. That would be great if people weren\\'t leaving left and right prior to being served! I personally watched 4 tables of our families get up and walk out after waiting at least 15-20 minutes just to have their order taken after being seated. That is simply outrageous and unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nThe same girl who forgot about seating us back in November tried to INSIST that my 8 month old baby sit in a booster seat because they can\\'t put the high chairs out in the aisles. I told her I needed a high chair and to sit us at a table. She kept trying to seat us in a booth and told me again about the whole high chair in the aisle policy. I told her I don\\'t care what your policy is, my 8 month old needs a high chair.....so we got seated at a table and she told me again no high chairs in the aisles. I don\\'t know if she is just dense or what but given that she still has a job there after the crap job she did back in November leads me to believe she must have naked pictures of somebody to still be working there....or they just don\\'t give a damn. Silently, I pushed a chair to her and took the high chair from her and seated the baby in it pulling it next to me so it was out of the aisle. She goes \\\\\"ohhhhh...that\\'s smart.\\\\\". O-M-G.....\\\\n\\\\nI hung in there because it was for the school, but honestly, we should have left as well because we waited 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken after the saga with just being seated. Drinks came and we placed our order. We ordered the Chicken Quesadillas to start, lobster ravioli for my son and a club sandwich with a side salad for me. The side salad came out first which puzzled me and concerned me that the waitress forgot our appetizer. I said nothing though and about 10 minutes later, the quesadilla came out. It was overdone and had that burned taste to it though it wasn\\'t burned in coloring. I think the quesadilla maker probably burned the quesadilla before they made mine and I got to taste the remnants. It was overly saucy to try to mask the burned flavor...though it wasn\\'t a very good job. :( The side salad was 1/2 cup of lettuce with a couple of grape tomatoes and 4 croutons. My son said the lobster ravioli was not very good and it tasted more like imitation crab meat to me when he gave me a taste. It also didn\\'t come with the bread stick that was advertised in the listing. *sigh* It\\'s for the school though so we hung in there....and waited 25 minutes for our check. Literally. We watched people waiting to have drink orders taken, waiting for their checks, waiting for their food...and mostly a whole lot of waiting.  It wasn\\'t just our server who was slow...the entire restaurant seemed to be in a time warp! It was un-freaking-believable. I asked to see the manager, and quite honestly, I\\'d still be waiting for him because he never came by my table. Waitress finally came back and said, \\\\\"You don\\'t want dessert, do you?\\\\\" Wow......but we ordered dessert to go just so we could get the hell out of there and up our bill for the school\\'s benefit. It was the very first time I\\'ve ever gotten a to-go cup of ice cream with the dessert but I digress. \\\\n\\\\nI doubt our school did very well in this fundraiser due to the horrendous service that everyone experienced. It was the hardest earned 20% I\\'ve ever given. Next time I\\'ll just make a donation to the school rather than go through that disaster of a dinner again. This TGI-Friday\\'s should be ashamed of themselves.

We ordered the butterfish tataki, kobe beef and kimchi dumplings, tempura shrimp, himachi serrano chili roll, and spicy tuna roll.  They brought the butterfish out first; it was good but not as good as some of the other reviews made it out to be.  The dumplings and shrimp were next, the dumplings tasted like regular dumplings you could get at any Asian restaurant and the shrimp were average as well.  At this point I started getting a little nervous that we were about to spend a lot of money on a very average meal.\\\\n\\\\nThat all changed when they brought out the sushi.  This is the best sushi I've ever had in my life.  It's the best quality fish I've ever seen which made it worth every penny.  We had barely made a dent in our sushi when I asked for the menu to order more!  We got another himachi roll, another tuna roll, and a soft shell crab roll.  The only small complaint I have about the sushi menu is that it's very limited.  I wish they'd expand it a bit.\\\\n\\\\nWe ended our meal with a chocolate cake that was served with peanut butter ice cream peanut brittle and caramel sauce.  It was very good but I could only take a couple of bites because I was stuffed.  My husband didn't mind, he cleaned the plate!  I think if we hadn't been at a restaurant he might have licked the bowl.\\\\n\\\\nThe service at Roka Akor is amazing as well.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and knew every item on the menu like the back of his hand.  He was also really great about my husband's food allergy.  My husband is allergic to avocados.  He wrote on the ticket that my husband had a food allergy and double checked before our food was served. He also offered to take the sochu off of our bill since my husband didn't like it, we declined but it was still really nice of him to offer.

And here\\'s MY bottom line up front:  if you are going here because you are a sushi lover, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  For the price of this dinner ($31.95/person for dinner Sun - Thurs) you can go to a very good sushi house and get your fill of really good sushi.  Folks, this is an all you can eat Chinese buffet with more sushi type offerings than most, but it is NOT great sushi at all.  I am giving this a \\\\\"2\\\\\" rating because it wasn\\'t bad, it just wasn\\'t good, nor do I think it lived up to its billing. \\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere:  Based the on line photos on on their website we assumed that this would be a somewhat upscale place.  We assumed wrong.  It was ..... an all you can eat Chinese buffet,complete with food on the floor, paper table covers, and located at the entrance, but inside the shops on the Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.  Dress ranged from cutoffs, muscle shirts, and flip flops to khakis with button down shirts and dresses.\\\\n\\\\nFood Presentation:  We arrived at 8:00 PM, and although the buffet continues to seat people until 9:30, we were surprised to see so many empty or close to empty trays on the buffet, and many weren\\'t restocked while we were there so it is hard to say how good the buffet might have been if it was fully stocked.  \\\\n\\\\nSushi:  The sushi was okay, but was in no way close to really good sushi.  The pieces were small which was okay since you can have as many as you want.  They were not well put together, and most fell apart when you picked them up from the buffet line.  If they didn\\'t fall apart there, they certainly did when you tried to eat them.  Several pieces were tasty, but most were very bland with little flavor.  The texture ranged from marginally chewy to almost grainy.  The salmon was by far the best piece we had.  \\\\n\\\\nRolls:  There were lots of different rolls available, but the labeling of the offerings was all messed up.  California rolls were marked as spicy tuna, and something labeled \\\\\"Shrimp Tempura Roll\\\\\" was ..... well I don\\'t know what it was, but it was NOT shrimp tempura.\\\\n\\\\nSeafood:  For a place that bills itself as a \\\\\"Sushi and Seafood Buffet\\\\\" there wasn\\'t much seafood beyond the sushi.  They advertise dungeness crab as a major offering, but the crab legs were only served cold, not hot.  And they were so salty that a salty food lover with us said that it was TOO salty even for her, so I didn\\'t even try it.\\\\n\\\\nSalads:  The salads presented were also \\\\\"okay.\\\\\"  Frankly I wasn\\'t very interested in eating too much salad in an all you can eat sushi and seafood buffet,.\\\\n\\\\nHot Food:  The hot food was \\\\\"okay\\\\\" as well, but again, it was NOT great.  There was a station presenting hand carved prime rib,  pork roast, and grilled sausage, except that there was no one manning it, so you couldn\\'t have any.  I waited about five minutes at the station, making eye contact and waving to every employee running behind the station before I finally got someone to come over.  And it looked like these offerings had been under heat lamps for many hours and perhaps they were because the meat was very dried out.  There were several  trays of baked fish and other hot entrees that had only a very small amount of leftover food on them, and what was left there was dried out and very unappealing.  Perhaps they weren\\'t going to refill these until someone took the last remnants, but looking at the dried up remnants on the corner of a large tray made me decide it wasn\\'t worth trying.\\\\n\\\\nDessert:  This was both a high and low point.  There were a number of good offerings in the dessert line, the chocolate covered strawberries were really good.  there were also a couple cookies that were very tasty.  The low point here is that they offer a \\\\\"build your own crepe\\\\\" station which looked great.....except that they didn\\'t have anyone manning it to make crepes, rendering it useless.'},\n",

An employee walked over and turned the tv, made me question how sanitary it was back there. After tasting our pizza, I would compare it to a frozen pizza from the grocery. I was so disappointed. I really did not like their sauce. It was thick, clumped in various places of the pizza and weird tasting. The crust was dense and flavorless. The cheese was fine but they could have been more generous with the toppings. My husband hasn't tried the spaghetti yet, but I won't be trying it as I'm sure the sauce is the same as the pizza sauce.

Yes, I am quite fond of Jeni\\'s Splendid Ice Cream (which, in Madison, is carried here and only here).  However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude. \\\\n\\\\nI stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it\\'s not as extensive as I\\'d expect--despite Fromagination\\'s artful arranging I\\'d venture a guess that Whole Foods\\' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can\\'t handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn\\'t quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \\\\\"Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\\\\\" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \\\\\"Ma\\'am, I\\'m having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.

With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I\\'m there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I\\'m merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they\\'ll steer me away from it! \\\\\"This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that\\'s what you want?\\\\\" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.

My husband, son and I went Sunday 2pm. The place was packed and we had a short wait. We were very excited to see the place packed translating to a good restaurant and seeing the food being served to other patrons looked delicious. Unfortunately, my $15.99 seafood bouillabaise was terrible because it had 2 small/medium size shrimps, 4 frozen (not fresh) mussels, 2 tiny pieces of fish, 2 small rings (size of nickel and dime) of calamari, 3 crab legs the length and width of my fingers that was fully intacted in the shell (with no means of cracking the legs open). It came in a deceiving big bowl only to have me fish around in the sauce for the seafood. Why do they even bother having this on the menu only to serve frozen mussels and teeny tiny seafood? My husband ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm he says. He hailed the waiter over and the waiter did remedy this by getting my husband a hotter cup of coffee. I was also excited to try the crispy pork from my husband's plate only to find it really hard to chew. Way over cooked/fried. The place was packed with Colombians so I would think its authentic and good. Don't go by my 1 star and not try this place, just don't order the seafood bouillibaise. Or maybe they just want to serve to Colombians? I'm fine with that. Its too bad we didn't have a good experience cause we are the type that would patronize a restaurant every week if we love it.

Our search began and ended here we decided to go old school I remembered a client telling me of her old days in Las Vegas when she was a showgirl hanging with the \\\\\"in\\\\\" crowd (the mafia) the show people and their cohorts.  So in the mood for some ambiance we decided to have some snacks here then move on for the rest of the night.\\\\n\\\\nWe pull up (Valet only) nice guy and walk in we already know we did not want the restaurant because we only wanted a few shared plates and cocktails.  So we opted for the front bar.  They had a small 3 person band think Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin style.  They have nice booths against the wall to cosy up in or a bar to sit and watch the small rooms happenings.  We chose the end of the bar to watch the performers eat our food and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.  The decor of the room I thought was both fun and funny, completely decked out in monkeys, monkeys everywhere!  \\\\n\\\\nNow on to the food...\\\\nProsciutto Con Melone thinly sliced Parma ham and melon.  I loved the way the salt of the thinly sliced Prosciutto went both agains and with the sweet, slightly bitter of the Mellon.  \\\\nAgnolotti Freschi Alla Crema, country style fresh pasta stuffed with spinach, served with cream sauce.  Amazing, one of the best pasta dishes I have had.  The home made pasta breaks apart easily (but not to easy) to be able to tell it really is fresh.  The cream sauce has enough flavor to showcase the gentle blending of flavors of the spinach and cream.  I chose to add pepper because I like the kick of it.\\\\n\\\\nOn to the service and ambiance the service is top notch but with a bit of the New York attitude (if you\\'ve been there you know).  Everyone is taking orders,bringing, cleaning or walking around to see if one of the priors need to be done.  In other words great old school service.  Ambiance, lots of interesting things to keep your eyes and ears happy.  Sit at the bar and get to know a few New York transplants, or tourist who have heard about the great pasta or some old questionable members of our community who could quite possibly be in the old school mafia...\\\\n\\\\nAny how The Pasta is great, the ambiance is fun, the bartenders know the wines and the servers know the menus, the people around you are a free added bonus.

The problem is, we\\'re staying at the Death Ray -- sorry, the Vdara -- and there are no restaurants per se in the hotel, and the Japanese restaurants nearby in the Bellagio or the Aria don\\'t open until dinner.

They have a beautiful Hario siphon setup, complete with halogen heaters, plus a La Marzocco 3-group Linea and three Mazzer grinders for espresso.  The Ethipoian Harrar siphon coffee we enjoyed was superb!

If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X\\\\n\\\\nBison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....)
